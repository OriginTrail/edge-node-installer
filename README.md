## DKG Edge Node v1.0.1

This installer provides an easy way to set up and run a DKG Edge Node on your system. 

For more details on the DKG Edge Node, visit the official documentation [here](https://docs.origintrail.io/build-with-dkg/dkg-edge-node).

## üìö About The Project

<summary>

### **What is the Decentralized Knowledge Graph?**

</summary>

<br/>

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/nodes.png" alt="Knowledge Asset" width="200">
</div>

OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), hosted on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN) as trusted knowledge infrastructure, is shared global Knowledge Graph of Knowledge Assets. Running on the basis of the permissionless multi-chain OriginTrail protocol, it combines blockchains and knowledge graph technology to enable trusted AI applications based on key W3C standards.

<summary>

### **What is the difference between a Core Node and an Edge Node?**

</summary>

<br/>

The OriginTrail DKG V8 network is comprised of two types of DKG nodes - Core Nodes, which form the DKG network core and host the DKG, and Edge Nodes, which run on edge devices and connect to the network core. The current beta version is designed to operate on edge devices running Linux and MacOS, with future support for a wide range of edge devices such as mobile phones, wearables, IoT devices, and generally enterprise environments. This enables large volumes of sensitive data to safely enter the AI age while maintaining privacy.

### **The OriginTrail DKG Architecture**

</summary>

<br/>

The OriginTrail tech stack is a three layer structure, consisting of the multi-chain consensus layer (OriginTrail layer 1, running on multiple blockchains), the Decentralized Knowledge Graph layer (OriginTrail Layer 2, hosted on the ODN) and Trusted Knowledge applications in the application layer.

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/dkg-architecture.png" alt="DKG Architecture" width="400">
</div>

Further, the architecture differentiates between **the public, replicated knowledge graph** shared by all network nodes according to the protocol, and **private Knowledge graphs** hosted separately by each of the OriginTrail nodes.

**Anyone can run an OriginTrail node and become part of the ODN, contributing to the network capacity and hosting the OriginTrail DKG. The OriginTrail node is the ultimate data service for data and knowledge intensive Web3 applications and is used as the key backbone for trusted AI applications (see https://chatdkg.ai)**

### **What is a Knowledge Asset?**

</summary>

<br/>

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/ka.png" alt="Knowledge Asset" width="200">
</div>

**Knowledge Asset is the new, AI‚Äëready resource for the Internet**

Knowledge Assets are verifiable containers of structured knowledge that live on the OriginTrail DKG and provide:

-   **Discoverability - UAL is the new URL**. Uniform Asset Locators (UALs, based on the W3C Decentralized Identifiers) are a new Web3 knowledge identifier (extensions of the Uniform Resource Locators - URLs) which identify a specific piece of knowledge and make it easy to find and connect with other Knowledge Assets.
-   **Ownership - NFTs enable ownership**. Each Knowledge Asset contains an NFT token that enables ownership, knowledge asset administration and market mechanisms.
-   **Verifiability - On-chain information origin and verifiable trail**. The blockchain tech increases trust, security, transparency, and the traceability of information.

By their nature, Knowledge Assets are semantic resources (following the W3C Semantic Web set of standards), and through their symbolic representations inherently AI ready. See more at https://chatdkg.ai
<br/>

## Build on DKG

<br/>

The OriginTrail SDKs are client libraries for your applications, used to interact and connect with the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph.
From an architectural standpoint, the SDK libraries are application interfaces into the DKG, enabling you to create and manage Knowledge Assets through your apps, as well as perform network queries (such as search, or SPARQL queries), as illustrated below.

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/sdk.png" alt="SDK" width="200">
</div>

The OriginTrail SDK libraries are being built in various languages by the team and the community, as listed below:

-   dkg.js - V8 JavaScript SDK implementation
    -   [Github repository](https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg.js/tree/v8/develop)
    -   [Documentation](https://docs.origintrail.io/dkg-v8-upcoming-version/v8-dkg-sdk/dkg-v8-js-client)
-   dkg.py - V8 Python SDK implementation
    -   [Github repository](https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg.py/tree/v8/develop)
