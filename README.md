## DKG Edge Node v1.0.1

This installer provides an easy way to set up and run a DKG Edge Node on your system. 

For more details on the DKG Edge Node, visit the official documentation [here](https://docs.origintrail.io/build-with-dkg/dkg-edge-node).

## About The Project

### **What is the Decentralized Knowledge Graph?**

</summary>

<br/>

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/nodes.png" alt="Knowledge Asset" width="200">
</div>

OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), hosted on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN) as trusted knowledge infrastructure, is shared global Knowledge Graph of Knowledge Assets. Running on the basis of the permissionless multi-chain OriginTrail protocol, it combines blockchains and knowledge graph technology to enable trusted AI applications based on key W3C standards.

### **What is the difference between a Core Node and an Edge Node?**

</summary>

<br/>

The OriginTrail DKG V8 network is comprised of two types of DKG nodes - Core Nodes, which form the DKG network core and host the DKG, and Edge Nodes, which run on edge devices and connect to the network core. The current beta version is designed to operate on edge devices running Linux and MacOS, with future support for a wide range of edge devices such as mobile phones, wearables, IoT devices, and generally enterprise environments. This enables large volumes of sensitive data to safely enter the AI age while maintaining privacy.

## Build on DKG

<br/>

The OriginTrail SDKs are client libraries for your applications, used to interact and connect with the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph.
From an architectural standpoint, the SDK libraries are application interfaces into the DKG, enabling you to create and manage Knowledge Assets through your apps, as well as perform network queries (such as search, or SPARQL queries), as illustrated below.

<div align="center">
    <img src="images/sdk.png" alt="SDK" width="200">
</div>

The OriginTrail SDK libraries are being built in various languages by the team and the community, as listed below:

-   dkg.js - V8 JavaScript SDK implementation
    -   [Github repository](https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg.js/tree/v8/develop)
    -   [Documentation](https://docs.origintrail.io/dkg-v8-upcoming-version/v8-dkg-sdk/dkg-v8-js-client)
-   dkg.py - V8 Python SDK implementation
    -   [Github repository](https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg.py/tree/v8/develop)
    -   [Documentation](https://docs.origintrail.io/dkg-v8-upcoming-version/v8-dkg-sdk/dkg-v8-py-client)
